= Metric manager
:description: This section describes the Metric manager of Neo4j Ops Manager.

The metrics page offers rich charts and tables with data related to your monitored DBMSs.
Currently three time windows are supported Live (30 minutes), 24 hours and 3 days worth of data.

The table in the *Host Metrics* tab and *Instance Metrics* tab includes static data for our DBMSs, like the cpu cores of our system (physical and logical) and memory.
